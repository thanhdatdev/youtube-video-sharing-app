Welcome to our YouTube Video Sharing App, a platform designed to simplify the process of discovering and sharing YouTube videos with friends, family, and the wider online community. Our application aims to enhance your video-sharing experience by providing a seamless platform where users can register, log in, and effortlessly share their favorite YouTube content.

## Key Features

   Our app offers a user-friendly registration and login system, ensuring that users can securely access their accounts and personalize their sharing experience. By registering, users gain access to a range of features and can start sharing videos with ease.
2. Sharing YouTube Videos:
   With our app, users can easily share YouTube videos they love with their network. Whether it's a hilarious cat video, a thought-provoking TED talk, or the latest music video sensation, sharing is as simple as copying and pasting the video URL into our platform.
3. Viewing a List of Shared Videos:
   Discovering new content is effortless with our app. Users can browse through a curated list of videos shared by others within the community. Whether searching for entertainment, education, or inspiration, there's something for everyone to enjoy.
